# Week 1 - Getting Started

## Warm-Up
[Medium.com](http://medium.com) -- you have 30 minutes to recreate this as best you can.  You can ignore the sidebar.

## Tools
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) - everyone should know how to use git.  We will be using it in client projects when we collaborate.
Additionally, it looks good to have things on your GitHub, so start pushing!
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

## Sublime Text Plugins
* [Sublime Package Manager](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
* [Emmet](http://emmet.io/)
* [FakeImg](http://fakeimg.pl/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Logistics
* CHUMMING! Add your chums on Facebook and set up a time to meet with them
by October 7th!  Don't be shy -- this is another way to branch out and meet 
people in the club.  This round's theme is "Groovy 70's".  If you can't think of
an idea, it's not an excuse not to meet up -- the point is to get to know your
chums better!  At least grab coffee/boba :) You can check who you are partnered 
with here: [tinyurl.com/wearethechumpians](http://tinyurl.com/wearethechumpians)
* TABLING! You should have all signed up for a tabling shift -- tabling started
today.  You can check the tabling sheet here: [tinyurl.com/tableable](http://tinyurl.com/tableable)

## Homework
* Spend some time going over your recreation of Medium and make sure to push 
to GitHub.
* Questions -- Google, fellow tier members, me!
