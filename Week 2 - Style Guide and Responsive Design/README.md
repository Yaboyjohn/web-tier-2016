# Week 2 - Style Guide and Responsive Design

## Logistics
* Hope everyone had a fun time chumming!
* We have a first project, but I need to get details worked out with the person
who requested it.  Hopefully we can get working on it next week.

## Warm Up
* I'm going to go through an HTML file I created and you're going to tell me
how to convert it to scss! - [https://github.com/jubearsun/hex-sp16](https://github.com/jubearsun/hex-sp16)
* Demonstrate Emmet :) - [https://github.com/cle1994/InnoD_Web_Handbook/blob/master/1-setup_and_basics.md#helpful-things](https://github.com/cle1994/InnoD_Web_Handbook/blob/master/1-setup_and_basics.md#helpful-things) 

## Why do we need a style guide?
* Everyone has their own unique styles and way that they do things -- however, 
since we will be working on projects together, code should be consistent!

## Why is responsive design important?
* Design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment
- your website is not done if it works on Desktop but doesn't look quite
right on mobile, or on a widescreen monitor.
* All client websites will need to be responsive!

## Style Guide
* Tabs and Spacing: We'll be using 2 space indents!  Make sure to configure
this in your text editor settings (at least when you're working on tier
projects)
* Naming conventions: [Airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css) to 
[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), we will be using `block__modifier--value`
    * There are a myriad of naming conventions out there, but this will hopefully 
    make it clearer to everyone on the tier what each style does.
* Divs over tables!
    * Lots of reasons, can Google it if you're interested
* Classes over IDs
    * Styling is always done with classes even if the class will only appear once 
    on a page, and IDs are used for selection in JavaScript.

## Media Queries
* Responsive design is the only way to design!  Never push something without
making sure it is responsive on all screen sizes.
* Use media queries -- I like to go from largest screen size to smallest screen
size.
* Chrome Developer Tools is your friend.

## Homework
* If you haven't yet, add cards to your Medium recreation and make everything
responsive.
* Rename your elements using the style guide above.
* Make sure you are using 2 space indents!
